    <p class="fancy details">Things that I use and like, professionally or otherwise.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</xa></strong>:
        my favorite editor ever.
        I was a reluctant Sublime Text convert, but the switch was more than worth it.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Theme: </strong>
            currently on <b><xa to="draculatheme.com/pro">Dracula Pro</xa></b>. It's a premium theme that includes skins for iTerm, Slack, etc. and that matches well with my pretty particular color preferences. But if I'm picking a free one, I'm probably going with the built-in <strong><xa to="marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=monokai.theme-monokai-pro-vscode">Monokai</xa></strong> theme.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Font: <xa to="www.monolisa.dev/">MonoLisa</xa></strong>.
            I’m a code nerd and a font nerd, so I don't take this choice lightly, but this is my favorite dev font. I love its combination of legibility and subtle personality, and plus, the code ligatures are great. (If you’re not willing to spend the money, though—and I definitely understand if that’s the case—
            <strong><xa to="github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira Code</xa></strong> is my runner-up.)
            </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Extensions</strong>:
            I don’t have too many global recommendations here (it depends a lot on what you’re working with), but I’ll mention:

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong><xa to="marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tobermory.es6-string-html">es6-string-html</xa></strong>:
                treats HTML inside template literal strings like actual HTML code, for the purposes of highlighting, code completion, Emmett, etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong><xa to="marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer">Bracket Pair Colorizer</xa></strong>:
                makes it easier to distinguish where a code block ends by assigning the same color to the opening and closing brackets.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong><xa to="marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pnp.polacode">Polacode</xa></strong>:
                a nifty, pretty way to take code screenshots
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong><xa to="marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare">Live Share</xa></strong>:
                the best way to collaborate on code remotely that I’ve ever used.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong><xa to="marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens">GitLens</xa></strong>:
                less indispensable now that VS Code has the <xa to="scotch.io/bar-talk/vs-code-v144-adds-a-git-timeline-view">Timeline view</xa>, but still amazingly handy for viewing git status and history in projects.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong><xa to="marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Compulim.compulim-vscode-closetag">Close HTML/XML Tag</xa></strong>:
                the only keyboard shortcut I miss from Sublime Text is easily replicated with this extension. Gives you a key command to auto-close whatever HTML tag your cursor is inside of.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong><xa to="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag">Auto Rename Tag</xa></strong>:
              does what it says; when you adjust the opening tag of an HTML element, it makes the same change to the closing tag, and vice versa.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong><xa to="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens">Error Lens</xa></strong>:
              some understandably find this extension obnoxious, as it outputs errors directly beside your code (rather than keeping them hidden until hover), but I appreciate them always being visible—both to prevent needing to hover or click something, and as a reminder to fix them.
              </li> 
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="localwp.com/">Local</xa></strong>:
        hands-down the best way to develop WordPress sites. Fast and easy (especially if you host with Flywheel or WP Engine; you can push and pull sites directly).
        </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="codekitapp.com/">CodeKit</xa></strong>:
        there’s nothing CodeKit does that I couldn’t accomplish by fiddling with NPM scripts, but why bother? It’s smooth and easy to use, and as a bonus, it works great with Local.
        </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</xa></strong>:
        I’ve tried other terminals, but none seem to run as well, and with the recent update, arguably, none look better, either.
        </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="www.netlify.com/">Netlify</xa></strong>:
        I’m also a fan of
        <strong><xa to="vercel.com/home">Now</xa></strong>, but Netlify has taken over my JAMstack hosting #1 spot. It’s free to start and unbelievably easy. Netlify makes the painfully difficult effortlessly simple.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Languages and frameworks</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        ES6+ JavaScript is my main language these days, and
        <strong><xa to="vuejs.org/">Vue</xa></strong> is my main go-to for anything I’m building (I’m unsurprisingly, therefore, a huge fan of
        <strong><xa to="nuxtjs.org">Nuxt</xa></strong> and
        <strong><xa to="gridsome.org/">Gridsome</xa></strong> as well).
      </li>
      <li>
        I’m also a big fan of <strong><xa to="svelte.dev/">Svelte</xa></strong>, and have made several projects in <strong><xa to="reactjs.org/">React</xa></strong> as well. I've got working experience with jQuery and Knockout and am working on implementing TypeScript in my projects.
      </li>
      <li>
        I love <strong>CSS</strong> passionately, but I don’t use any libraries or frameworks; all my CSS is from-scratch, responsive, and custom (usually written in
        <strong><xa to="sass-lang.com/">SCSS</xa></strong>). I love authoring smooth, fluid transitions and animations.
      </li>
      <li>
        I'm a strong proponent of well-architected, accessible, and semantic <b>HTML</b>. (I create and use SVG often.)
      </li>
      <li>
        I’m a <xa to="wordpress.org/">
        <strong>WordPress</strong></xa> expert and generally prefer to build themes from scratch. I'm capable with PHP and MySQL.
      </li>
      <li>
        Professionally, I've worked with Ruby on Rails and Laravel backends.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>General</h2>



    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</xa></strong>:
        took some getting used to, but it’s a great browser with some awesome tools. It may not be as performant as Chromium browsers in some regards, but I personally view that as feature, not a bug; if I can make a transition or animation smooth in Firefox, I know it's buttery everywhere else, too.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="www.getcloudapp.com/">CloudApp</xa></strong>:
        taking screenshots and videos is a many-times-daily activity for me, and CloudApp makes it as seamless as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="rightfontapp.com/">RightFont</xa></strong>:
        a simple, minimalist app for managing your computer’s fonts that looks and works better than Mac’s built-in FontBook.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="www.anker.com/products/variant/xanker-24g-wireless-vertical-ergonomic-optical-mouse/xa7852011">Anker 2.4G Wireless Vertical Ergonomic Optical Mouse</xa></strong>:
        I could feel my wrist straining using both a magic mouse and a touchpad. I switched to this mouse years ago. It took some adjustment, but I don’t ever want to use another mouse again, and I don’t even use the extra buttons.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-mac/">Kinesis Freestyle2 for Mac</xa></strong> keyboard:
        I paid for months of sitting-on-the-couch laptop time with a repetitive stress injury on my right wrist. This keyboard is a bit of an adjustment, but it has helped a lot with the wrist pain by keeping my wrists from going to outward angles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/sayl-chairs/">Herman Miller Sayl Chair</xa></strong>:
        I made it about two months as a full-time work-from-home employee before I went and bought one of these chairs. It’s the most comfortable and easily adjustable office chair I’ve ever sat in (and it looks really nice, too).
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Productivity &amp; Utility</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <xa to="http://xalfredapp.com"><strong>Alfred</strong></xa>:
        the first thing I install on every new Mac. (I use the <xa to="www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/">powerpack</xa> for added features, which is worth every penny.) The main features I love are clipboard history, snippet expansion, global search (never touch Finder again!), and workflows to automate repetitive or tedious tasks. Wouldn’t ever want to work without it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="rectangleapp.com/">Rectangle</xa></strong>:
        never drag or resize another window again. Keyboard shortcuts to put everything right where you need it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="www.macbartender.com/">Bartender</xa></strong>:
        helps wrangle all those app icons in your taskbar if you’re a minimalist like me.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="matthewpalmer.net/rocket/">Rocket</xa></strong>:
        lends you Slack-like ability to use emoji anywhere. Way better than the OSX default emoji picker.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="notion.so">Notion</xa></strong>:
        my current favorite notes app. Can grow and get as complex as you need it to be, but for simple notes, the markdown and code highlight support is fantastic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="1password.com">1Password</xa></strong>:
        I’ve tried and liked other password software, but 1Password is just the most reliable cross-platform and -device in my experience.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Design and Illustration</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="xaffinity.serif.com">Affinity Photo, Designer and Publisher</xa></strong>:
        you can have software 90% as good as Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign <em>forever</em> for the cost of three months of Creative Cloud.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/intuos-pro-small">Wacom Intuos Pro PTH-451</xa></strong> (small):
        I don’t often illustrate these days, but when I do, I’m always glad I have this fantastic pad. Wireless is a big plus.
      </li>
    </ul>
