    <p class="fancy details">Things that I use and like, professionally or otherwise.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</xa></strong>:
        my favorite editor ever.
        I was a reluctant Sublime convert but the switch was more than worth it.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Theme: </strong>
            I use the built-in <strong><xa to="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=monokai.theme-monokai-pro-vscode">Monokai</xa></strong> theme.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Font: <xa to="https://www.monolisa.dev/">MonoLisa</xa></strong>.
            I’m a code nerd and a font nerd. This is my favorite dev font. (If you’re not willing to spend the money though—and I definitely understand if that’s the case—
            <strong><xa to="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira Code</xa></strong> is my runner-up.)
            </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Extensions</strong>:
            I don’t have too many global recommendations here (it depends a lot on what you’re working with), but I’ll mention:<ul><li>
            <strong><xa to="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer">Bracket Pair Colorizer</xa></strong>:
            makes it easier to distinguish where a code block ends by assigning the same color to the opening and closing brackets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong><xa to="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pnp.polacode">Polacode</xa></strong>:
            a nifty, pretty way to take code screenshots
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong><xa to="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare">Live Share</xa></strong>:
            the best way to collaborate on code remotely that I’ve ever used.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong><xa to="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tobermory.es6-string-html">es6-string-html</xa></strong>:
            treats HTML inside template literal strings like actual HTML code, for the purposes of highlighting, code completion, Emmett, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong><xa to="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens">GitLens</xa></strong>:
            less indispensable now that VS Code has the <xa to="https://scotch.io/bar-talk/vs-code-v144-adds-a-git-timeline-view">Timeline view</xa>, but still amazingly handy for viewing git status and history in projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong><xa to="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Compulim.compulim-vscode-closetag">Close HTML/XML Tag</xa></strong>:
            the only keyboard shortcut I miss from Sublime Text is easily replicated with this extension. Gives you a key command to auto-close whatever HTML tag your cursor is inside of.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="https://localwp.com/">Local</xa></strong>:
        hands-down the best way to develop WordPress sites. Fast and easy (especially if you host with Flywheel or WP Engine; you can push and pull sites directly).
        </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="https://codekitapp.com/">CodeKit</xa></strong>:
        there’s nothing CodeKit does that I couldn’t accomplish by fiddling with NPM scripts, but why bother? It’s smooth and easy to use, and as a bonus, it works great with Local.
        </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</xa></strong>:
        I’ve tried other terminals, but none seem to run as well, and with the recent update, arguably, none look better, either.
        </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</xa></strong>:
        I’m also a fan of
        <strong><xa to="https://vercel.com/home">Now</xa></strong>, but Netlify has taken over my JAMstack hosting #1 spot. It’s free to start and unbelievably easy. Netlify makes the painfully difficult effortlessly simple.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Languages and frameworks</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        JavaScript is my main language these days, and
        <strong><xa to="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</xa> </strong>is my main go-to for anything I’m building (I’m unsurprisingly, therefore, a huge fan of
        <strong><xa to="https://nuxtjs.org">Nuxt</xa></strong> and
        <strong><xa to="https://gridsome.org/">Gridsome</xa></strong> as well).
      </li>
      <li>
        I’m also a big fan of
        <strong><xa to="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</xa></strong>, and I know
        <strong><xa to="https://reactjs.org/">React</xa></strong> as well, which is also cool but it’s not my favorite.
      </li>
      <li>
        I love
        <strong>CSS</strong> passionately, but I don’t use any libraries or frameworks; all my CSS is from-scratch and custom (usually written in
        <strong><xa to="https://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</xa></strong>).
      </li>
      <li>
        I’m a <xa to="https://wordpress.org/">
        <strong>WordPress</strong></xa> expert and generally prefer to build themes from scratch (as with this one).
      </li>
      <li>
        Professionally, I work in Ruby on Rails with SCSS and HAML templates using Vue components.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>General</h2>



    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</xa></strong>:
        currently in the middle of trying to convert again after failing last time. Liking what I see so far. (<xa to="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwji7e3c_PzoAhXPZc0KHazlCD4QFjAAegQIERAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbrave.com%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2CfcgN6wLi3270uJRtAJ62">
        <strong>Brave</strong></xa> is my fallback choice.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="https://www.getcloudapp.com/">CloudApp</xa></strong>:
        taking screenshots and videos is a many-times-daily activity for me, and CloudApp makes it as seamless as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="https://rightfontapp.com/">RightFont</xa></strong>:
        a simple, minimalist app for managing your computer’s fonts that looks and works better than Mac’s built-in FontBook.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="https://www.anker.com/products/variant/xanker-24g-wireless-vertical-ergonomic-optical-mouse/xa7852011">Anker 2.4G Wireless Vertical Ergonomic Optical Mouse</xa></strong>:
        I could feel my wrist straining using both a magic mouse and a touchpad. I switched to this mouse years ago. It took some adjustment, but I don’t ever want to use another mouse again, and I don’t even use the extra buttons.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Productivity &amp; Utility</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <xa to="http://xalfredapp.com"><strong>Alfred</strong></xa>:
        the first thing I install on every new Mac. (I use the <xa to="https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/">powerpack</xa> for added features, which is worth every penny.) The main features I love are clipboard history, snippet expansion, global search (never touch Finder again!), and workflows to automate repetitive or tedious tasks. Wouldn’t ever want to work without it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="https://rectangleapp.com/">Rectangle</xa></strong>:
        never drag or resize another window again. Keyboard shortcuts to put everything right where you need it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="https://www.macbartender.com/">Bartender</xa></strong>:
        helps wrangle all those app icons in your taskbar if you’re a minimalist like me.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/">Rocket</xa></strong>:
        lends you Slack-like ability to use emoji anywhere. Way better than the OSX default emoji picker.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/intuos-pro-small">Notion</xa></strong>:
        my current favorite notes app. Can grow and get as complex as you need it to be, but for simple notes, the markdown and code highlight support is fantastic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="https://1password.com/">1Password</xa></strong>:
        I’ve tried and liked other password software, but 1Password is just the most reliable cross-platform and -device in my experience.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Design and Illustration</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="https://xaffinity.serif.com">Affinity Photo, Designer and Publisher</xa></strong>:
        you can have software 90% as good as Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign <em>forever</em> for the cost of three months of Creative Cloud.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><xa to="https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/intuos-pro-small">Wacom Intuos Pro PTH-451</xa></strong> (small):
        I don’t often illustrate these days, but when I do, I’m always glad I have this fantastic pad. Wireless is a big plus.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>This site</h2>

    <h3>Colors</h3>

    <ul id="brand-colors">
      <li v-for="color in colors" :key="color" class="color">
        <div class="swatch" :style="{ backgroundColor: color }"></div>
        <span>{{ color }}</span>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Fonts</h3>

    <p class="fancy details"><strong>A note on fonts:</strong> up to six fonts may load on a page, which is admittedly quite a few by web standards. I didn't want to compromise on the design, though, so I used other means to mitigate the performance impact.
      <br/><br/>For one, MonoLisa only loads on blog posts, and the bold italic weight of Averta only loads on a few pages, so it's actually only four most of the time. That's still a lot, but they're all subsetted, so they average about 25kb each. Plus, I use font-display: swap to make sure there isn't a wait while they're loading.</p>

    <FontTester font="Pensum Display Basic"/>
    <FontTester font="Averta STD"/>
    <FontTester font="Averta STD" fontStyle="italic" label="Averta STD italic"/>
    <FontTester font="Averta STD" fontWeight="bold" label="Averta STD bold"/>
    <FontTester font="Averta STD" fontWeight="bold" fontStyle="italic" label="Averta STD bold italic"/>
    <FontTester font="MonoLisa"/>
