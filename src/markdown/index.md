he last few years.You’ve probably noticed it, too: every creative agency, whether it's a design boutique, an advertising house or a marketing giant, has a permanent need for developers—a position which, if ever filled, seems to empty itself again sooner rather than later.

No matter how big, how prolific or how renowned an agency is, there seems to be a Wile E. Coyote-style spring-loaded chair at the developer's desk, waiting to launch the next person who sits in it back to the job market.

I seem to constantly get emails, texts and other messages all the time asking the same question:

_Do you know any developers who are looking for a job?_

More often than not, the message is coming from a person at a creative agency of some kind, whether tiny or large, that lost their main developer. And 98% of the time, my answer is _no_. I genuinely don’t; most of the developers I know are very happy where they are. (The ones who aren't tend to find new jobs, and find them fast.)

Which isn't to say that I don't know anybody with _some_ programming skill who wants a new job. I do. But there's a problem: creative agencies have high standards for developers. Sure, I know people who _want development jobs_, recent graduates of tech programs, self-starters and a lot of really great folks looking to make a career change so they can start learning a new trade in-depth. But that isn't what any creative agency is looking for; their standards are much, much higher than that. They're looking for a senior-level, do-it-all workhorse type of developer, one who can take any creative idea thrown at them and make it happen.

Which, of course, is the first reason that creative agencies can’t keep their developers:

### Creative Agencies don’t realize that developers are not designers

Design and development are similar in so many ways. The circles of their venn diagram have a sizable overlap. But the areas _outside_ that center tend to be roundly ignored in the design community (pun fully intended), at least when those differences aren’t directly in service to the agency’s needs.

To be clear: I don’t think creative agencies treat developers poorly out of selfishness or a lack of respect; I think they just don’t realize that designers and developers are very different animals and that you cannot afford to treat them the same way (financially or otherwise).

Consider: a designer coming out of a school program in which he or she spent the last 2–4 years training as a graphic designer is facing a career field where only about 10% of graduates find full-time employment. _Ten percent!_

> Your average developer is roughly fifteen times more in-demand than your average designer.

And those young designers know it; that’s why they’ve been working their asses off to build their portfolios, why they’ve been taking every internship they can get their hands on, and why they’ve been attending every AIGA event and design meet-up they can find. I don't know the numbers for advertising and marketing students, but I'd imagine the numbers aren't significantly better, at least not for the quality, full-time jobs available in those fields.

Developers, on the other hand, after as little as 3–4 months of some kind of code school, find themselves in a career field where the number of job openings outnumber the people available to fill them 3:2.

Think about what that disparity means just in terms of sheer math: _your average developer is roughly fifteen times more in-demand than your average designer._

Creative agencies don’t seem to realize this, and instead, continue treating their developers as though they were designers—driven, nearly desperate creatives so grateful just to have a full-time job that they’ll likely sacrifice both salary and personal time just to be doing what they love.

Not that developers aren’t driven, or creative, or grateful, or even willing to make sacrifices to do what they love. To the contrary; most developers I know are also among the kindest, most passionate, patient and sacrificing people I know. But unlike designers, _they don’t have to be just for the sake of keeping a job_.

One developer I’ve spoken to said a creative agency where he interviewed proudly offered him the kind of salary that would be offered to a graphic designer of a comparable experience level. The word he chose to describe that salary, when comparing it with the far more appropriate offers he was getting elsewhere considering his skill and experience, was “insulting” — and this is _not_ a person who values money over the other factors of a job.

> If creative agencies want to keep their developers, they must stop treating their developers like designers.

But let’s set money aside for a second. Designers can be expected to be good at everything they do; they’re competing with nine other designers for their full-time job. Designers _have_ to possess creative thinking skills and be familiar with the whole Creative Suite. They need to be great at typography, color selection, and layout. They should be able to work in print or web, and be as good at editing a photo as they are at building a vector logo. They need to have some UI/UX skills, and they had better be good at presentation. A designer who can do it all is still among the most common, because a designer knows that any employer can have their pick of nine others for the same price or lower.

In fact, there are more than a few design, marketing and advertising agencies out there that burn through design interns like AA batteries, knowing there will be an endless supply of low-paid, quality talent available at all times.

By contrast, a developer who knows front-end, is proficient in CSS, can build in WordPress, is familiar with some JavaScript libraries and frameworks, understands PHP, can work with SQL, integrate with APIs, handle web animation and knows how to work with servers and domains is among the cream of the crop—a crop (to continue with the metaphor) that everybody’s lining up to buy.

In general, a developer isn’t competing with other developers for their job; a creative agency is competing with _other potential employers_ for the developer_._

If creative agencies want to keep their developers, they must stop treating their developers like designers.

### Creative agencies expect too much from developers

I’ve talked to a great many developers who either left design firms or rejected a position they were offered by one. The stories paint a pretty grim picture.

One developer I know told me that he was expected to put in the same amount of hours as the designers at the agency where he formerly worked, regardless of how quickly the work itself got done. If designers were at their desks, he was expected to be at his desk as well.

This was compounded by the fact that he, a senior developer, could easily accomplish his work in well under a 40-hour work week, given adequate focus, while the designers at the same firm were routinely putting in 50–60-hour work weeks. (Yet another indication that creative agencies seem to be completely unaware of how to distinguish between designers and developers, and to value their time and output differently.)

> There seems to be a perception that, because developers can do their work in a chair, happily coding with headphones on, the work must be easy to do and easy to come by. It isn’t, and it’s not, and creative agencies need to do away with that perception.

Another told me that his former agency expected him to be billing 100% of his time—_a full 40 hours a week_—to client projects. That’s obviously an unrealistic and rigid requirement for _any_ kind of worker, and yet, the agency also heaped internal projects on him, which he was apparently expected to complete on his own time. Still, neither his salary nor his allotted vacation time reflected the position of somebody effectively expected to essentially perform two jobs at once.

Another told me that he was expected to be available via email every hour of the day in case of a web emergency—effectively on-call every waking moment—and yet was also expected to be at work, at his desk, pumping out code from 8–5 every weekday, and would be chastised if he so much as _looked_ at his own phone during those hours. In essence, his personal time belonged to the company, but there was no flexibility in his work time to make up for that imbalance.

Some of these examples are admittedly a little extreme. Most creative agencies aren’t that severe. But it highlights an existing problem:

There seems to be a perception that, because developers can do their work in a chair, happily coding with headphones on, the work must be easy to do and easy to come by.

It isn’t, and it’s not, and creative agencies need to do away with that perception.

### Creative Agencies think of development last

We all know you should involve your developer in the design process early, right? I’m going to skip over that point (though if you don’t currently get your developer involved in the early creative rounds, you need to. It can save you a lot of headaches down the road).

That caveat aside, it makes total sense, from a practicality standpoint, to put site development last in the overall project work. After all, designers are likely in charge of wireframes and mockups, and the developer can’t get a lot of work done without those—let alone the images, logos and other assets needed for a site. Putting site development last on the assembly line makes the most sense.

But a large problem arises when you put _anybody_, let alone a developer, between creatives and clients on one side and an interminable deadline on the other.

Imagine this:

Let’s say you have a client rebrand project, complete with website, that’s slated to last twelve weeks. Naturally, things like discovery, client meetings, sketches, internal process and eventually, design presentation all come before site development. Then there are wireframes, mockups, prototyping…lots of things usually happen in client work before a developer is ever actually doing their job. That’s fine.

But…

How likely is it that the client will fail to provide everything they’re supposed to somewhere along the way in that process, and the team will be left waiting on them as a deadline flies by? (_Answer: very. That’s what clients do._)

And how likely is it that the designer(s) will be working up to the last possible minute, and will maybe even push their own deadline back, thereby preventing anybody else further down the line from starting on their own work? (_Answer: highly. That’s what designers do._)

And how likely is it that, as the smaller benchmark deadlines get moved further and further back, and as more and more allowances are made for both the creatives and the client, the client still adamantly _insists_ that the site goes live by the end of the twelve weeks just as promised, and the agency caves in to them out of both sense of obligation and fear of losing money? (_Answer: almost certainly. That's what agencies do._)

All of these events—totally normal in the creative agency world—combine to create a system in which developers are asked to do the most work with the least amount of time. If they were supposed to have four weeks for the website, they sit by helplessly as it gets turned to three, and then two, and eventually the developers are pulling all-nighters through no fault of their own because _everybody around them failed at their jobs to some degree._

I don't mean to be harsh on this point (or any). But based on what I've heard from many, many developers, I can safely say that developers frequently leave creative agencies because the people around them aren't doing their jobs properly.

Developers are routinely asked to shoulder the deficiency of the rest of the team, and creative agencies don’t seem to realize it or have any idea how to correct it.

### We can still develop this relationship

The relationship between developers and creative agencies doesn’t have to end; it just needs to be repaired. And that's done with three easy steps:

1. Pay developers what they're worth
2. Have realistic requirements for developers, and keep their role in perspective
3. Treat a developer's time and efforts with respect

That's really all there is to it. I really don't want to see creatives and developers break up. I don't think they need to. I don't think they _should_.

I just think agencies need to show them a little love.

The good news is that none of this is personal. Give most developers a choice, all other things being equal, between doing really cool creative work or corporate websites, and they'll take the cool thing every time. Developers don’t _want_ to find jobs working for banks or insurance companies or other big corporations. They don't leave for the money, generally speaking. They _want_ to work with you, designers and agencies. They want to be part of something cool, something beautiful, and if possible, something _meaningful_, just like you do. They realize the power and importance of design, and they _care._

It's time agencies cared, too.
