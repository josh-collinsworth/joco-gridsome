WordPress is an undeniably amazing tool, and one of the most amazing things about it is its phenomenal community. WordPress is, of course, an open-source project that is worked on by hundreds of people around the world, which means that it's constantly updating and improving. However, therein lies a bit of a conundrum, because while it's certainly in the best interest of WordPress as a whole to be continually adding new and better features, it has to be careful not to override the elegant simplicity that made it approachable for beginners in the first place.

So there are certain things that some of us who work with WordPress on a regular basis wish it could do right out of the box, but it sadly can't for whatever reasonâ€”most likely in the interest of maintaining lightweight simplicity. What follows, then, is my list of plugins that I find myself installing on virtually (if not literally) every site that I build.

### Enable Media Replace

If you're like me, you've done this about a thousand times: upload an image to the WordPress media library; fill in the alt field and maybe a few others; copy the link to the page or post you're editing (probably in another browser tab); hit the "preview" button and realize the image you just uploaded somehow isn't quite right, so you need to head back to edit or re-save it before you can start the whole process again.

In WordPress's default state this is an even bigger headache, because you're forced to choose between two options:

1. Ignore the image you already uploaded, which means the new one will have a different permalink;
2. Permanently delete the image you already uploaded so that you can upload the new one.

In either of these cases, you're stuck re-editing anything you changed about the image in the meantime, like the alt tag, title, description, etc.

In short, trying to replace an image in the WordPress media library sucks.

Enter Enable Media Replace. Now when you want to update an image, you can simply replace _the image file itself_ rather than need to re-enter or alter any data you already entered.

### Advanced Custom Fields

Ok, ok, I can hear some of you saying: _really__? I know ACF is awesome, but should it be included in WordPress right out of the box?_

All right, no, it probably shouldn't.

### Rename wp-login.php

Hackers suck.

### Show Current Template

Develo3rz!

### Duplicate Post

Copy and paste. There. Was that so hard?
