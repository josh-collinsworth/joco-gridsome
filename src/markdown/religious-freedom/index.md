Much has been made lately of so-called "religious freedom" laws, most recently in Indiana. For those unfamiliar, these laws are generally drafted to allow any person to deny their goods and/or services to any other party if the former claims that providing said product and/or service substantially compromises his or her own religious beliefs.

At face value, these laws may not sound harmful, but in practice, it's generally conservative Christians on the former side and almost always homosexuals on the latter. This would be conspicuous enough on its own were it not for the fact that, to my recollection, no Christian—let alone the whole of the religious right—ever expressed concern about who was purchasing what from them or for what purpose, publicly or otherwise, before homosexuality and homosexual marriage were involved. This, along with the wording generally used in these bills and the circumstances surrounding their inception, inexorably leads to at least a reasonable suspicion that it is not religious or any other type of freedom so much as the targeting of a particular group at the heart of these bills.

Regardless, I personally find the idea that these laws are protecting any sort of freedom debatable at best, but I'm not going to address that particular point or debate the merits of such laws here. I have a different angle in mind, namely: should Christians be denying anybody in the first place?

It should be noted that the range of denominations and doctrines which fall under the broad umbrella of "Christian" is both widely diverse and increasingly divided in its views on virtually all issues, homosexuality included. The popularity of the version of Christianity espoused by the religious right notwithstanding, the sociopolitical beliefs of those who self-identify as Christian run the full gamut from conservative to liberal, just as with virtually any other large group of people. So within that broad spectrum of beliefs and interpretations of the Bible, a person who identifies as Christian does not necessarily believe that homosexuality is in some way wrong, as most conservative Christians generally do. To the contrary, many who practice Christianity actively support gay rights and/or believe that the teachings of the Bible are not meant to be interpreted as anti-homosexual. Some believe that the Bible predates modern understanding of homosexuality (the term was coined in fairly recent history) and thus could not possibly have a stance on it one way or the other, while a not insignificant number of Christians are themselves gay.

Regardless, however, I don't feel one needs to address that particular point or even reach a consensus on that divisive topic to see that there is little or nothing Christ-like about the above "religious freedom" laws and the practices that accompany them. Whatever finer points the wide range of people who call themselves Christian may debate, their collective namesake exists because of their shared belief in the teachings of Jesus, who said these words in Matthew 5:39–42 (NRSV):

_"But I say to you, Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also; and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat, give your cloak as well; and if anyone forces you to go one mile, go also the second mile. Give to everyone who begs from you, and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you."_

It is difficult to the point of impossibility for me to believe that the Jesus who told His followers to turn the other cheek to those who physically assault them, to work twice as hard for those who take advantage of their labor, and to freely offer their possessions to those who steal from them—to give and lend to _anyone_, evildoer or no, with no mention of exception—intends for those followers to refuse their goods and services for any reason or to any person.

I do not see any ambiguity whatsoever in this passage. Not only did Jesus fail to give any exception or condition for His words, but He even included the word "evildoers" (or its ancient equivalent, anyway). So even if we assume homosexuality _is_ wrong (and to be clear: I do not take that stance, but hypothetically, even if I did), the commandment given by Jesus is not to guard any kind of personal interest (freedom included), nor to avoid taking part in the evil being performed; it is so directly contrary that the word "opposite" isn't strong enough to describe it.

In that light, I truly don't understand how any Christian can conclude that refusing to sell a cake to a gay couple, as the popular example goes, is anything vaguely supported by the teachings of Jesus.

I have attempted to remain restrained in my language thus far, but I am going to make this point strongly, because I want to be clear that I am being absolutely unequivocal:

A god who sets two humans apart, then tells his followers that the first is worthy of beating, abusing and impoverishing them, while the second is not even fit to receive something from them in exchange for money, is not any god I believe in, and is not a god whose teachings align with those of Jesus.

That god, I firmly believe, exists only in the imagination of humans.
