title: "My Five Favorite Productivity Apps for Mac"
date: "null"
---

First things first: yes, this article has the word "Mac" in its title. It's not that I dislike Windows or Microsoft at all, really. In fact, I really like the direction they've been heading the last few years. It's just that a) the places I work all require me to work on a Mac, and b) some of my favorite software only exists on a Mac. Believe me, I'd love a Surface Pro 3. But for what it's worth, most of the stuff on this list either exists on both Mac and PC, or has analogous PC counterparts.

Now, on to the list.

If you're a business owner, marketer, or anybody interested in growing any kind of brand, what you want to create are "brand ambassadors." These are people who love you, the service you provide and/or the business you run so much that they willingly and vocally advocate for it.

Well, for each of the items on this list, you can call me a brand ambassador.

Over time, I've been introduced to a number of helpful, time-saving and/or convenient apps that have helped to streamline my workflow. Here, I'm going to share those with you simply in the hopes that you might find some or all of them simplifying and bettering your workflow (if not  your life in general) in the same way they have mine.

## 1\. Dropbox

You probably already know that [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) is a cloud storage service that offers a plethora of plans and storage limits, from small free plans to massive shared business plans. In 2015, you're probably already familiar with the concept. You've maybe even used Dropbox or something similar, such as Google Drive. If so, you know that many other services offer basically the same features that Dropbox does, but Dropbox gets the nod for me, for the following reasons:

**Dropbox can sync to your computer _and _the cloud at the same time.** All you do is set up an app on your machine, which creates a Dropbox folder. This folder functions just like any other on your computer, except that when  you add files to it, those files are automatically uploaded to Dropbox as well. Conversely, anything you upload to Dropbox (from anywhere—you can have Dropbox on multiple machines in multiple locations) will automatically be downloaded to your synced folder.

**Dropbox is basically a data insurance policy. **The advantages of this are _huge_: if your cloud goes down, you still have your files backed up locally, and vice-versa; an inoperable machine doesn't mean losing your files. You can recover them on any new machine with a simple download. I don't save anything even remotely important anywhere but my Dropbox folder. In addition, with the Pro plan (and possibly others), you can have Dropbox wipe all your files from a device remotely in case it gets lost or stolen, while your cloud data still stays safe and available.

**Dropbox also gives you massive amounts of memory for not a lot of money. **Google Drive may have Dropbox beat in the pricing category, but a full _terabyte _of storage for $9.99 a month (or $99 a year) on their [Pro plan](https://www.dropbox.com/en/pro) is ridiculously good, especially when you think of it in the above terms.

**Sharing with Dropbox is easier than Google Drive. **I've had somebody send me a link to something on Google Drive only to be told that I didn't have permission to access it countless times. I've never had that happen with Dropbox.

**Dropbox includes backups. **You can restore any file in your Dropbox to a previous version, or even recover deleted files, for 30 days. (I believe this perk is Pro only, but I may be wrong.)

**Plus many other useful features. **You can have your phone synced up with your Dropbox to automatically upload your photos. No more worrying about device space. Plus, you can share folders, join somebody else's shared folders, send files too big to email, request files and give people a singular place to upload all their files (saving you tons of email exchanges), set passwords for shared links and/or cause shared links to expire after a certain period of time.

In short, Dropbox takes a lot of the things that are terrible about the digital age and turns them into awesome things.

## 2\. LastPass (etc.)

![LastPass](https://blog.lastpass.com/wp-content/uploads/logo@2x1.png)

The headline on the [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) website reads "simplify your life"—and it does just that.

**Remembering and typing passwords is a huge drain on mental energy.** This is especially true in the era when everyone has at least two email addresses, a password for their phone and for both their personal and work computers, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Amazon, eBay, maybe a personal website, logins for work, and on and on and on. It's too much.

LastPass is one of a number of services that store all your passwords together in one place, behind a singular master password, thus effectively reducing the total number of passwords you're required to remember down to exactly one.

**Not only do you never have to remember passwords, you never even have to _enter_ them. **If you don't want to go the copy-and-paste route to pull your passwords out of storage, LastPass works as a browser extension. You save all your passwords in your "vault," and any time you're on a page that matches a user name and password combo you've saved, LastPass automatically fills in the login form for you. All you need to do is click.

**LastPass can also generate a random password for you** (a great idea), of which you set the length and complexity, and it will then save that password to your vault. You only have to remember your one master password, and you don't even need to have any idea what the rest of your passwords are; LastPass has that all covered. It can even update some passwords automatically.

Oh, and by the way, it's dirt cheap. Can you think of _anything _you spend only $1 a month on? Because that's how much LastPass costs.

I put the _etcetera_ in the header of this item because there are other services besides LastPass that accomplish this same thing. Lately I've been using [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) instead, which has slight advantages and disadvantages compared to LastPass. (LastPass deals with login forms using Captcha better, for example, but 1Password is less intrusive when you don't want to use it.)

## 3\. Alfred

![Alfred](http://emilychang.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/alfred.png)

Sorry, Windows users; this one is only for Mac.

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)'s benefit is a subtle one. So subtle, in fact, that it's difficult to adequately explain. For a start, it's a _way _better search function than OS X's default Spotlight feature (so much better, in fact, that I disable the default Spotlight shortcut on my machine and have it toggle Alfred instead).

**Alfred is a better, faster search function for finding files on your machine.** It can be set to include or ignore virtually any folder, including those on external servers. This is what led me to my love of Alfred; I once had to use click after click after click to navigate file directories on my old employer's server. With Alfred, all I did was search once for the file and open it. The search is very flexible, too; it doesn't feel like it's being too strict with matching what I type. But if all else fails, it will just search Google for what I type.

**You can also use Alfred to search for a file, and then open its containing folder in the Finder.** This is super handy when you know you need to quickly get to a folder several layers deep.

**Alfred also does math, checks spelling, and lots more.** Like I said, it's difficult to explain exactly what it is that makes Alfred so great, but once you start using it, you'll realize how much of the rest of your workflow becomes expendable. No more calculator. No more opening the browser for a web search or a spell check. I've even seen people remove their app dock altogether in favor of simply using the Alfred shortcut to open programs. (Bonus: it pairs exceptionally well with the Dropbox app to both save all your files and make navigating them a cinch.)
