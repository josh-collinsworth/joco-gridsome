## The Inspiration

A few years ago, I watched a documentary called "[Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead](http://www.fatsickandnearlydead.com/)." If it sounds like a bummer of a film, it's actually surprisingly uplifting. I won't go too heavily into the specifics of the documentary here, but the main takeaway is that as humans, our bodies are surprisingly adept at repairing themselves—as long as we'll get out of the way and let them. Our bones heal when they're broken as long as we don't move them, our cuts and bruises heal as long as we aren't picking at them and—one that most people don't think about—our digestive system and internal organs can heal themselves if we'll stop interfering with them.

"Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead" chronicles the journey of a dangerously overweight Australian businessman named Joe Cross as he committed to staying out of his body's way by consuming absolutely nothing except water and fresh-juiced fruits and vegetables for a period of 40 days. (Fresh-juiced, by the way, means just that: nothing from a can or bottle. The juice is extracted when it's drank.)

This process, which Joe calls a "[reboot](http://www.rebootwithjoe.com/)," allowed his body to flush out the fats and toxins he'd been storing in it for his entire adult life—as well as repair itself in other ways. Joe had a skin disorder, for which he was taking heavy medication. The reboot reportedly allowed his nervous system to fix its crossed wires and repaired his skin disorder.

Since watching this documentary some five or six years ago, I'd been wanting to try a reboot (albeit on a smaller scale), but had never found the time. My wife and I bought a juicer not long after watching the film and had used it a handful of times. I even did a 24-hour juice fast once, though it was miserable. Still, I'd always had it in the back of my mind that I wanted to go further. Three days. Maybe even a week. I'm not significantly overweight, but I'm also not in shape and haven't always eaten very healthily.

It occurred to me suddenly one week early this year that there was never going to be a better time than the present.

## The Trigger

Erika, my wife, was studying for an important (and robust) certification test, so she was preoccupied with her own concerns when this idea struck me. I was working a job that allowed me flexible hours and not much physical exertion, and we had an open weekend coming up. It was the winter, so there wouldn't be any yard work or house projects to be done. I realized suddenly that if I was ever going to do this, I wasn't going to get a more perfect opportunity.

## Lesson 1: Make a Goal, and Write It Down

Shortly before deciding to embark on this personal experiment, I downloaded the app [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/), inspired by a fellow [AIGA Nebraska](http://nebraska.aiga.org/) board member. Looking back, it was a perfect coincidence.

Wunderlist is essentially a checklist app. It lets you set up various checklists (adding reminders, prioritization and due dates as desired) to keep track of anything from a shopping list to tasks and goals.

My overall goal was to make it a full week juice fasting, but I broke that goal down into several Wunderlist tasks that I'd be able to check off as I accomplished them. To start off with on Friday morning, my list looked like this:

- Juice for 24 hours
- Juice for 48 hours
- Juice for the entire weekend
- Juice for a week

I also told Erika about my goal. Not that she wouldn't have noticed that I was constantly running to Whole Foods and buying insane amounts of fruit and vegetables, but saying it out loud makes it real. I told my wife about my goals before I'd ever taken any other action on them. That's what make me say to myself, _ok, now I really have to do this._

It's easy to fail yourself. We let ourselves down all the time. It's a lot harder to fail somebody else, and have to explain to them why you're not following through on what you said you were going to do. Speaking your goal, even to one person, makes you feel like you're not just in this for yourself; you're trying to keep your word to somebody else, too.

It was immensely rewarding at the end of the day on Friday to get to check that first item on the list. And then the next one the next day, and then to know that I'd successfully made it the entire weekend. The app's tiny "ding!" sound effect from checking those items off the list as I achieved the smaller goals on my way to the larger ones were immensely satisfying, and they made me want to keep going.

## Lesson 2: Prepare Well

I knew going into the fast that it was going to be rough to start. One of the things I remembered everybody from the documentary saying was that the first three days or so are miserable. Joe said he stayed in bed pretty much all day the first few days. Other people mentioned how hard it was to give up their preferred food and beverage vices at first.

Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention: this fast not only involves no solid foods, but no caffeine as well. No soda, no tea, and most pertinent to me, no coffee.

To be honest, I cheated on that front a little bit; I decided to drink my usual amount of cold brew coffee the first day, and then halve it each day after that. So on day 3 I'd be having only a quarter of the coffee I normally do, and I'd give it up completely for days 5, 6 and 7. I felt this would help to stave off the effects of caffeine withdrawal and make the fast a little easier. And for what it's worth, I was right.

However, I realized that giving up caffeine wasn't as hard as I thought it was going to be, and I think this is because I already had my coffee habit pretty well under control.

I'm not the kind of person who (usually) drinks coffee after lunch, and I never have it with sugar. I drink iced coffee, black, in the morning only. And I think having this habit pre-established made it much easier for me to wean myself off of caffeine than it would have been if I'd been accustomed to constantly ingesting sugary, caffeinated beverages.

On top of this, I mentioned that I tried juice fasting for 24 hours once, and that it was miserable. It was; I had a headache and exhaustion, and because of that experience I was expecting the first 24 hours of this fast to be similarly punishing.

But to my pleasant surprise, it actually wasn't nearly as difficult as I was expecting. And with that fact came the realization: I was doing it all wrong the first time.

When I did my first 24-hour fast, I was working as a server, so I was on my feet burning calories all day. I was also not in the habit of hydrating well, which is something imperative to your success in a juice fast. And lastly, I probably wasn't actually drinking _enough_ juice.

### Side Note: The Rules

These are the generally accepted rules for a juice fast like the one I was doing, but they can vary depending on your personal needs and goals.

1. You consume nothing other than _fresh_ fruit and vegetable juice, and water, for the entire duration of the cleanse. Some people advise occasionally eating a vegetable as needed, but I wanted to be sure that I followed the rule to the letter and didn't chew once for seven days.
2. You may have as much juice as you like, but you must juice it yourself. Fresh does not mean from a can or a bottle; fresh means "straight from the actual fruit or vegetable to your glass, in your presence."
3. The fruits and vegetables should be organic. They don't necessarily _have_ to be (and this is one way to save on the financial cost of juicing), but if the point of a cleanse is to rid your body of toxins, organic produce will be at least marginally better than conventional.
4. Hydrate. Drink all the water you want or need.
5. Don't be active at all. You aren't ingesting enough calories for it.
6. Avoid fruit and stick to vegetables later in the day (as the sugar and carbs from many fruit juices are less productive later in the day).
7. Try to vary the fruits and vegetables used (to get the best range of nutrients and to avoid burnout).
8. Listen to your body.

## Lesson 3: It's Not as Hard as You Think

## Lesson 4: Your Body is Built to Fast

This may be at least in part due to the fact that I already had some good dietary habits established going into the fast, but I'll be honest: I was surprised that the difficulty wasn't higher. I was expecting worse.
