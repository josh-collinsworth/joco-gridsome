WordPress multisites are complex beasts, especially when it comes to working with their domains—which you’re often required to do when attempting to work locally, go live with new host, or start a staging site.

WPMultisiteDomainReplace.com is a mini app designed for just one thing: it gives you the SQL command you need to run against your WordPress multisite database in order to change the whole network’s domain.
