[Design in Quotes](https://designinquotes.com) was a year-long weekly collaborative creative project that ran from 2014â€“2015. I was a nascent designer at the time and partnered with my brother, a writer, on the project.

The idea was: each week he would provide a piece of writing, and I would come up with a design, illustration, and/or some kind of interactive media to pair with it.

While I don't feel all my entries were particularly strong, it was an excellent experience for an aspiring professional creative as I was, as it gave me freedom to explore design, illustration and especially code in ways that I hadn't before.
