summary: Pixel art from a weekly writer/designer collaboration series.
---

This was part of [Design in Quotes](https://designinquotes.com), a weekly collaboration between myself and my brother, who is a writer. For each entry in the series, he'd write something, and I'd come up with some sort of design, illustration and/or code to accompany his piece.

While I don't consider most of my entries particularly good (I don't think I'd probably put illustration in my top three skills), I enjoyed how this one turned out.
