I was tired of trying to use to-do/checklist apps; there’s always too much upfront effort for something that should be as instant as writing on paper.

So I made qvicklist.com: a simple, easy and (of course) quick app for creating a one-off to-do list or checklist.

QvickList is built on Vue and utilizes local storage, so that as long as you’re accessing the app from the same device/browser, your list and its status is always available just as it was before.
