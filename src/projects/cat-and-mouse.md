summary: A silly game that an animated cat won't let you win.
liked: It's fun and silly and gave me a chance to play with some interesting JavaScript.
disliked: I wish the cat went cross-eyed when the cursor was in between its eyes. I'm sure I could do that if I put the time into it, but the math was too much for my brain at the time. (Also, I wish Firefox was better with CSS filters, or that I'd just known that at the time and left them out.)

This was an amusing little CodePen project to demonstrate tracking mouse movement, and (faking) hijacking the cursor using CSS. Try it out [here](https://codepen.io/joshuajcollinsworth/pen/ExjZexY/).
