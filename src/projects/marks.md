A client website for a neighborhood bistro, with email signup, minor eCommerce components, and some custom features. The header updates based on the time and day to display the relevant kitchen hours, and the menu page is interactive, allowing guests to filter by dietary restrictions. All menu items are client-editable from the backend with Advanced Custom Fields.
