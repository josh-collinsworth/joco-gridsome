A tool to convert RGB and hexadecimal color values (with or without alpha) back and forth, with automatic detection and a fairly forgiving format.

The pen also previews your entered color; offers a button to quickly copy the converted value to your clipboard; and it includes a dark mode so that you can see your previews against a light and dark background.
