title: Connect Four in Vue and CSS
featuredMedia: projects/connect-four.png
link: https://codepen.io/collinsworth/pen/MWwXpLd
order: 2.9
category: websites, code + apps
tags: [app, game, vue]
summary: The classic game remade with Vue and playable in the browser.
liked: Figuring out how to make the game work was a fun challenge. (JavaScript's new optional chaining made the task significantly easier.)
disliked: I feel I left the design at about 80–90% on this one. There could've been more, especially in the "end game" state. Would've been cool to highlight the winning combination.

The classic game of Connect Four in Vue and Sass. Play by either clicking a slot, or using the keyboard.

I tried to make the game as accessible as I could, given the nature of it. The pen uses emoji and contrasted colors to be as colorblind-accessible as possible. It’s also keyboard accessible (use tab or arrow keys to select your moves), and uses aria labels and a status role for communication with assistive technologies.
