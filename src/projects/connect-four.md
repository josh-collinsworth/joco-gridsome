The classic game of Connect Four in Vue and Sass. Play by either clicking a slot, or using the keyboard.

I tried to make the game as accessible as I could, given the nature of it. The pen uses emoji and contrasted colors to be as colorblind-accessible as possible. It’s also keyboard accessible (use tab or arrow keys to select your moves), and uses aria labels and a status role for communication with assistive technologies.
