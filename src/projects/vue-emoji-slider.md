---

A custom slider built with Vue using emoji. The slider maintains accessibility by using CSS grid and z-index to place an actual range input HTML element over the top of the styled slider, at opacity 0. This way, the user is interacting with the semantic element (whether via mouse, touchscreen, keyboard or screen reader) while the styled slider is displayed onscreen.
