title: Interactive JavaScript Keyboard
featuredMedia: projects/js-keyboard.png
link: https://codepen.io/collinsworth/pen/VPXVbW
category: websites, code + apps
order: 3
tags: [interactive, javascript]
summary: An interactive project inspired by Wes Bos's JavaScript 30.
liked: This was one of my first major JavaScript projects, and it was really fun to figure it all out.
disliked: I'm sure there's tons I could do better here, both in the JS and the CSS, being something I built so long ago. It'd also be cool to make the other keys, like alt, work like shift does and show the altered characters.

One of my earlier major vanilla JavaScript projects that I took on to start exploring the world of JavaScript beyond jQuery. (Hat tip to Wes Bos and javascript30.com.) This pen just visualizes what you type both on the keyboard and in word form above it.
