title: Emoji Pick Two
featuredMedia: projects/emoji-pick-two.png
link: https://codepen.io/joshuajcollinsworth/pen/vYOPKqx
order: 3
category: websites, code + apps
tags: [interactive, silly, javascript]
summary: A checklist to send to your next client.
liked: This was a fun, silly little side project that I enjoyed both building and sharing.
disliked: I probably should've found some custom colors rather than trying to make it with my own website's color palette. The JavaScript is probably a little janky due to the timing of things, too.

A dynamic table in CSS grid and Vue, demonstrating the relationship between nine units of liquid measurement, from milliliters to gallons. You can update any one of the units, and the others respond and update dynamically. Table is also responsive and makes use of CSS transform to look a little different on mobile-ish widths vs. wider tablets and desktops.
