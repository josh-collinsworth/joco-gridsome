title: Emoji Pick Two
featuredMedia: projects/emoji-pick-two.png
link: https://codepen.io/joshuajcollinsworth/pen/vYOPKqx
order: 3
category: websites, code + apps
tags: [interactive, silly, javascript]
summary: A checklist to send to your next client.
liked: This was a fun, silly little side project that I enjoyed both building and sharing.
disliked: The design is ok, but I probably should've found some custom colors rather than trying to make it with my own website's color palette. Also, the custom cursor does more to distract than enhance, and I think the variety of different animations involved is borderline intrusive.

We're all familiar with the old adage: "Fast, cheap, good; pick two." I thought it would be amusing to translate that choice into an actual form element.
