summary: A playground for CSS filters, with the ability to test on your own images.
liked: I had fun digging deeper into reusable components and thinking about how their props and data might change.
disliked: The presentation could probably be a little more interesting and dynamic than just a card grid.

I thought it would be a cool project to build a reusable React component that shows off each filter mode that CSS offers. Each “card” is an interactive instance of the same custom React <Filter /> component, with props adjusted for the filter mode to demo how that specific filter works and what the code to use it would look like.
