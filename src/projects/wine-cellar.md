A client website for a neighborhood bistro. Just a simple, fast single-page site built with [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org) and flavored with minimalist typography, rich imagery, and subtle loading effects.

(Note: due to Covid, the live domain has expired; the updated now.sh domain will still work to access the site, however.)
