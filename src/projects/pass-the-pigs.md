My first real solo, built-from-scratch React project, this is a React app specifically for keeping score in the game Pass the Pigs. Optimized for mobile usage, this app is built to help players who are new to the game quickly tally rolls and know how to play. Modal messages explain how to get started, the endgame, and the winner.

This app was built with create-react-app defaults; all layout, CSS, animations, etc. are completely custom. Try it out at passthepigs.now.sh.
