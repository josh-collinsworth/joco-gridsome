summary: A website for an internal Flywheel all-company retreat.
liked: Adding all the creative flourishes to make this feel like a video game in an arcade cabinet, including all the little hidden Easter eggs, was a delight.
disliked: Probably should've made the default volume lower and had a bit of a warning about it. Or maybe even given sound controls. Oh, well.

I had the honor of building the website Flywheel's all-company retreat. I also [wrote about the process](https://getflywheel.com/layout/leveling-up-flywheels-retreat-website/) for Flywheel's blog, The Layout.
