summary: A rebrand project for merging medical practices.
liked: This was my first major solo rebranding project as a designer, and I feel the solution we arrived at reflected the brand's identiy and core values successfully. There's also a huge sign on a building in Omaha with my design on it, so that's cool.
disliked: The two halves of the N are actually not perfectly identical. It's imperceptible to the eye unless you zoom in on the vector file by like 3000%, but I've always known it and it's always bugged me.

This was a [David Day | Associates](https://dday.com) project; I was fortunate enough to be the lead designer on the project while working at the firm. [Ready the full case study on the DD|A website](https://dday.com/case-studies/nebraska-spine-pain-center-brand-unification/).

This was part of a full rebrand backage for [Nebraska Spine and Pain Center](https://nebraskaspineandpain.com/), a new identity created by Lincoln and Omaha practices joining forces.
