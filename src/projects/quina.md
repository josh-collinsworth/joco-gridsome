summary: A new twist on a classic word game
---

Quina is a slight twist on the classic word game "bulls and cows" (though the better-known variant is Master Mind). It's a word game of strategic deduction, as players guess five-letter words attempting to uncover the secret code word, receiving a new clue with each guess.

You can view the game at quina.app; it uses your browser's localStorage to keep track of your gameplay history, stats, and over two dozen unlockable awards.
