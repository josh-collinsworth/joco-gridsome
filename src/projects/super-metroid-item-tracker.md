Iâ€™m a huge fan of the game Super Metroid. (In fact, I might even call it my all-time favorite.) I enjoy speed running the game as an amateur, but frequently missed one or two items during my 100% attempts, so I built a checklist.

The Super Metroid Item Tracker (SMItTy, for short) is a Svelte app that records your item collection using local storage, so your results will be saved on your device. It also offers three sorting methods and a couple of extra options to fine-tune item display.
