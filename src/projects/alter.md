summary: A rebrand for a prominent Chicago real estate developer
liked: this was one of the biggest projects I ever worked on as a professional designer, and I'm proud to have it in my portfolio. I'm also proud that, although we went through three rounds of revision (and there were tweaks to all), the client eventually went with the first option and palette.
disliked: I designed the site but didn't build it, and wasn't very savvy with web development at the time. Knowing what I do now, I'm sure my design would have evolved to better utilize the platform.

This was a [David Day | Associates](https://dday.com) project; I was fortunate enough to be the lead designer on the project while working at the firm. [Read the full case study on the DD|A website](https://dday.com/case-studies/alter-rebrand/)

This was part of a full rebrand backage for [The Alter Group](https://www.altergroup.com/), a well-known Chicago real estate developer.
