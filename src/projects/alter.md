summary: A rebrand for a prominent Chicago real estate developer
liked: This was one of the biggest projects I ever worked on as a professional designer, and I'm proud to have it in my portfolio. I'm also proud that, although we went through three rounds of revisions (and there were tweaks to all), the client eventually went with the original concept and color palette.
disliked: I designed the site but didn't build it, and wasn't very savvy with web tech at the time. I'm sure the design would've benefitted from a more informed approach. (Though in fairness, it was made in what I would consider jQuery's heyday.)

This was a [David Day | Associates](https://dday.com) project; I was fortunate enough to be the lead designer on the project while working at the firm. [Read the full case study on the DD|A website](https://dday.com/case-studies/alter-rebrand/)

This was part of a full rebrand backage for [The Alter Group](https://www.altergroup.com/), a well-known Chicago real estate developer.
