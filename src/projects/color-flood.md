This is a pretty common little game, but I thought Iâ€™d challenge myself to rebuild it in React. The goal is to get the board to be entirely one color in as few moves as possible.

This version features a colorblind mode to populate the board with color-correlated emoji, and some instructions in the JavaScript (in the form of comments) that allow for changing board size and adding more colors.
