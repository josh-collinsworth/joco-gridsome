summary: A version of the classic game built with React.
liked: I had a lot of fun building it. Working in grids in JavaScript is not easy, and the logic involved in the color changes was very complex, but I'm proud I figured it out.
disliked: I'm sure the accessibility could be much better beyond the colorblind feature.

This is a pretty common little game, but I thought Iâ€™d challenge myself to rebuild it in React. The goal is to get the board to be entirely one color in as few moves as possible.

This version features a colorblind mode to populate the board with color-correlated emoji, and some instructions in the JavaScript (in the form of comments) that allow for changing board size and adding more colors.
