featuredMedia: projects/the-wine-cellar-logo.png
order: 3
link: https://marks-wine-cellar.now.sh/
category: design + illustration
tags: [logo, brand]
summary: A new logo identity for a local wine shop.
liked: Coming up with a new brand that leveraged the old one and even included its own logo inside of the new logo was a fun challenge that I think was pulled off well.
disliked: The fact that both businesses had to either shut down or radically pivot due to Covid.

**NOTE:** due to COVID-19, this website and business is no longer open in this form or under this brand. Its `now.sh` URL remains active to view the website.

[The Wine Cellar at Marks](https://marks-wine-cellar.now.sh/) is a small, one-page website for a local retail wine shop. I decided to use [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org) for the project to keep the site lean and fast, and sprinkled in some nice loading effects for interest.
