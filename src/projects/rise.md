summary: Website for a Flywheel employee resource group.
liked: It was awesome to be able to contribute to this project. The design isn't mine, but the execution is, and I think it turned out quite well.
disliked: Since getting the site up on a tight timeline was a priority, the content wasn't very well abstracted at all for future editing. That was on the road map while I was still at Flywheel/WP Engine, but didn't come to fruition before my time there ended. It would've been cool to be a part of though.

It was an honor and privilege to be asked to build the website for Rise, an employeee resource group for people of underrepresented racial groups and allies at Flywheel. I can take no credit for the design or the content, but I attempted to hint at the mission with the "rising" animations.

The site was built with Gridsome to maximize performance and make launching as quick and seamless as possible. [View the repo here.](https://github.com/josh-collinsworth/rise)
