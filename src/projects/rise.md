It was an honor and privilege to be asked to build the website for Rise, an employeee resource group for people of underrepresented racial groups and allies at Flywheel. I can take no credit for the design or the content, but I attempted to hint at the mission with the "rising" animations.

The site was built with Gridsome to maximize performance and make launching as quick and seamless as possible. [View the repo here.](https://github.com/josh-collinsworth/rise)
