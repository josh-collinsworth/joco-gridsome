A sticker project with a design that promotes Pride in the US by combining the rainbow flag with the US flag.

This concept was born out of a desire to show inclusion to the LGBTQ+ community at a time when displays of US patriotism are often co-opted as exclusion. America belongs to all of us, and we should all be able to feel proud of it. America isn't just white and/or straight; it's colorful and gay and bi and trans and non-binary and everything any of us as Americans are. This is intended as a means of expressing that idea.
