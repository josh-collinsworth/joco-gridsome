title: Fly Fest 2020
featuredMedia: projects/fly-fest-2020.png
link: https://fest.getflywheel.com/
category: websites, code + apps
order: 1.6
tags: [wordpress, animation]
summary: A website for an internal Flywheel all-company retreat.
liked: Taking these design elements and running with them was super fun. Adding touches to the site like the CRT mode and subtle blinking animation when switching between time zones was a blast, and I think added to the already excellent retro futurism.
disliked: I might have gone just a little overboard with some of the animations. Maybe.

Once again in 2020, I had the privilege of building the website Flywheel's all-company retreat. The design and visual elements were created by Flywheel's stellar designers, but the animations and implementation were fun to create "on the fly."
