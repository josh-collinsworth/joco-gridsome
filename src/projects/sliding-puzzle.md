summary: The classic puzzle game recreated in Vue and custom CSS.

Inspired to put Vue’s built-in transition-group element to good use, I decided to try recreating a classic sliding puzzle with Vue and CSS grid.

That took an evening; then I spent the next week scope-creeping myself into ensuring solvability within the random tile distribution; adding a progress bar; highlighting tiles in the proper position; highlighting possible moves; some animations; and adding support for mouse, keyboard, and swipe.

Update: there’s another version here with custom images instead of numbers and more gameplay options.
