# Josh Collinsworth Gridsome Site

This was originally built using Gridsome's WordPress starter, but now that I've abandoned WordPress, it's just pure static Markdown files and Vue templates.

To get this running on your own:

1. Clone the repo to a folder on your machine (or download it and unzip it);
2. Inside the repo, run `yarn` (assuming you already have yarn installed; if not, `npm install` will work if you've got NPM);
3. Once that's finished, run `yarn dev` (or `npm run dev`)
