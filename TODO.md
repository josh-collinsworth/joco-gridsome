# To do:

* Make sure the WordPress uploads are working properly, or ditch them
 * This includes the redirects in Netlify.toml
* Be sure all the links in the \<head\>, etc. are correct
* Double check that there are no more images to clean up
* Make sure headings and header nav links are the color I want
