# To do:

* Figure out how to use Prism (I'm in the middle of it in WordPressPost.vue)
* Make sure the WordPress uploads are working properly, or ditch them
 * This includes the redirects in Netlify.toml
* Be sure all the links in the \<head\>, etc. are correct
* Double check that there are no more images to clean up
