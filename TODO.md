# To do:

* Make sure the WordPress uploads are working properly, or ditch them
 * This includes the redirects in Netlify.toml
* Be sure all the links in the \<head\>, etc. are correct
* Double check that there are no more images to clean up
* Make sure headings and header nav links are the color I want
* Fix up the callouts and add the class to my blog posts
* Evaluate whether bolditalic is worth it (I think so but weigh the cost)
* Add RSS?
* Add PWA support?
* FINISH REDIRECTS
* Fill out all the new projects' info
 * Decide how to handle project images
* Figure out how to handle multiple project categories
* Figure out why things delay when toggling dark mode
* Add typography grid project; consider trimming projects
